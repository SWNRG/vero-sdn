**VERO-SDN Controller**
 under major update (expected soon...)

The *VERO-SDN Controller*, located in the infrastructure network, constitutes the heart of the WSN. 
Operating on a computer system with high computational power and memory, performs costly computations and equips the WSN with centralized decision-making features.
